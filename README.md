# Project Overview: Implementing a Face Generation Neural Network Using DCGAN
In this project, I implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Network (DCGAN) using CelebFaces Attributes dataset (CelebA). The end-goal of this project is to get a generator network to generate new images for faces that look as realistic as possible.
Specifically, I defined and trained a DCGAN architecture for this project. Interested readers can go through [DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf%C3) for the details on DCGN architecture.
